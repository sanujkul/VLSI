# VLSI
LTSpice Implementation and analysis of VLSI designs learned in college in the course ECC20

## List of Experiments:

### 1. Simulate a 2 stage CMOS op amp and determine 
   (i)   DC characteristics,   
   (ii)  frequency response,   
   (iv)  slew rate and   
   (v)   transient response.    
   
   Detailed experiment report is here : https://github.com/sanujkul/VLSI/blob/master/CMOS-OpAmp/Experiment-Report.pdf. 
   
   #### Results:  
   a. The opamp saturates after |Vin| > 40 mV  
   b. It is a low pass frequency response with 3 db bandwidth = 1.588 kHz  
   c. Slew rate = 20 V/us  
   f. DC gain = 42 dB  

### 1.  Simulate following 3 input Psedo NMOS gates
   (i)  NAND Gate
   (ii) NOR Gate
